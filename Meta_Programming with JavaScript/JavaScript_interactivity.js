    JavaSctipt Interactivity: 

        The purpose of this reading is to introduce you to a simple explanation of web page manipulation and some examples 
        of it. 

    Did you know that JavaSctip's initial purpose was to "provide interactivity in the broswer?"

    In other words, it was the "set of controls" that would allow web developers to control the behavior of the webpages
    and even the browsers that these webpages worked on. 

    This is still the case today. 

    As the web ecosystem developed and the world become ever more digized, so did the myraid of ways that one can use 
    JavaSctipt as a web developer to manipulate websites. 

    Initially, in the late 1990s, there was plain JavaScript that had to be tweaked to suit individual browsers. 

    Then, by the mid-2000s, the jQuery library came out, with the idea of writing less code, but doing more with it. It 
    "leveved the playing field" as it allowed developers to use a single code-base for various browsers. 

    This trend continued and many other frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, D3, and more came along. 

    Together with npm and Node.js, the JavaSctipt ecosystem is not slowing down. 

    Even though it has gone a long way, sometimes it's good to go back to the basics. JavaSctip is still the king when it 
    comes to making our websites interactive. 

    Although CSS has developed significantly over the years, it is still JavaSctipt that allows users to: 
        * Get their geolocaiton, 
        * Interact with maps, 
        * Play games in the browser, 
        * Handle all kinds of user-triggered events, regardless of the device
        * Verify form input before sending it to the back end of a webapp, 
        * and more. 
        * 
    There are many, many ways in which JavaSctipt allows you to build rich, inteactive experinces on teh web.
