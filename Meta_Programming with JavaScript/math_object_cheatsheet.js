    Math object cheatsheet: 

        JavaScript has handy built-in objects. One of these popular built-in objects is the Math object. By the end of this 
    reading, you'll be able to:

    * Outline the built-in properties and methods of the Math object. 

    Number constants: 

        * The PI number: "Math.PI" which is approimately 3.14159...
        * The Euler's constant: "Math.E" which is appromimately 2.718
        * The natural logarithm of 2: "Math.LN2" which is approimately 0.693
        * 
    
    Rounding methods: 

        These include:

        * "Math.ceil()" - round up to the closest integer
        * "Math.floor()" - rounds down to the closest integer
        * "Math.round()" - rounds up to the closest integer if the decmial is ".5" or above; otherwise, rounds down to the
        closest integer. 
        * "Math.trunc()" - trims the decimal, leaving only the integer

    Arithmetic and calculus methods:

    Here is a non-inclusive list of some common arithmetic and calculus methods that exist on the "Math" object. 
        * "Math.pow(2, 3)" - calculates the number "2" to the power of "3", the result is "8"
        * "Math.sqrt(16)" - calculates the square root of "16", the result is "4"
        * "Math.abs(-10)" - returns the absolute value, the result is "10"
        * Logarithmic methods: "Math.log()", "Math.log2()", "Math.log10()"
        * Return the minimum and maximum values of all the inputs: "Math.min(9, 8, 7)" returns 7, "Math.max(9,8,7)" returns 9
        * Trigonometric methods: "Math.sin()", "Math.cos()", "Math.tan()", etc.
